This repository contains a WP7.1 phone project which holds both an access
library to the Untappd service and also a test application. This library may
be of use to anyone wanting to application for Untappd on either the windows
phone or windows desktop and eventually Xbox.

This is work in progress, I am also working on my own app and I am developing
the library for that work and will maintain it as best I can to track changes
in the Untappd API.

The application here will simply be a tester for the API rather like the API 
Exporer provided by Untappd.

In order to use the library component in this Repo you must first obtain a
API key from Untappd see their website Untappd.com for details
